# Top_Movie_Challenge
This collection of visualizations serves as a hub for interactive insights based on the top 100 grossing movies, by year, for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The dataset has been scrubbed from Box Office Mojo.

Main Objective:
A lot goes into making a movie. But a lot of thinking goes into it's production and distribution as well. These visuals seek to shed light on some characterstics of the top movies that can help aspiring filmmakers set themselves up for the largest succcess (apart from actual film quality.)

Challenges:

Process:

Next Steps:
I'd like to continue exploring the "before" and "after" of producing a hit movie through additional datasets. For example, upon the availability of weekly gross sales, it would be interesting to explore the general trajectory of film sales over time. Does this also follow a linear trend? Is there a clear relationship of decreasing marginal returns to each additional week after the film has been introduced? Does this plateau?

It would also be interesting to look at other components such as language, lead actor, and lead actress in a movie as I would imagine these would also have a high effect on viewership.
